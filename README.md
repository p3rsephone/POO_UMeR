# UMeR
University project for POO (Object Oriented Programming) in Java.

## So, what is this?
In this project we were challenged to create an [UBER](https://www.uber.com) like platform in Java called UMeR. We had to make an interface for users and drivers alike and, for the sole purpose of clarity, we decided to make a graphic interface.

## Ok, but how do i run it?
After compiling everything with javac, you can just run the GUI by typing:
```
$java GUI
```

## I want MOAR
For an extended manual and documentation, there is a fantastic [document](https://github.com/p3rsephone/POO_UMeR/blob/master/relatorio.pdf) containing all the information you need to know about this. It is in portuguese though.
